##Description

- API we used: Get All Manufacturers, 
  Link to the API: https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getallmanufacturers?format=json

- Our visualization shows a bar chart of the countries with the number of car manufacturers.

- What visualisation or other JS libraries does your project use?

- What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?

- The application allows users to filter cars based on the country of manufacture. By selecting a specific country or choosing "ALL," users  can view the corresponding vehicle data. The application then generates a chart using the Chart.js library to present the data in a   visually appealing manner. The purpose of this project is to be providing users with a tool to explore and analyze vehicle data based on   country filters. By visualizing the data, users may gain insights into the distribution, characteristics, or trends of vehicles manufactured  in different countries.
